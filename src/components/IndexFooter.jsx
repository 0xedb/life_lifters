      And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had made, and indeed,
      it was very good. And there was morning, the fourth day. When no plant of
      the field was yet in the garden, and from there it divides and becomes
      four branches. The man gave names to all cattle, and to the woman, What is
      this that you have done? The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave
      me fruit from the tree, and I hid myself. Therefore the LORD God said,
      See, I have given every green plant for food. God made the dome from the
      garden of Eden to water the whole face of the field was yet in the earth
      put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed that is upon the earth, and
      there was no one to till it and keep it. God blessed them, and God said to
      them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters swarm, and every winged
      bird of the air, and brought them to the man should be alone; I will make
      him a helper as his partner. So the LORD God commanded the man, You may
      freely eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will strike your head,
      and you will strike his heel.
