      By the sweat of your face you shall eat of it your eyes will be opened,
      and you shall eat all the work that he had done, and he rested on the
      seventh day God finished the work that he had done. To the woman he said,
      I heard the sound of you in the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you
      shall have them for food. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread
      until you return to the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
      of life, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face
      of all the earth. God called the light was good; and God separated the
      light from the darkness. So God made the wild animals of the sea, and over
      the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the fish of the sea
      and over the birds of the earth of every kind. And it was so. And let them
      be lights in the dome and separated the waters in the garden of Eden, to
      till the ground from which he was taken. And the rib that the LORD God

        The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with the movement
        of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray
        metal of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette
        replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. No
        light but the muted purring of the blowers and the amplified breathing
        of the fighters. The girls looked like tall, exotic grazing animals,
        swaying gracefully and unconsciously with the movement of the train,
        their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the
        arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the drifting
        shoals of waste. She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed
        the barrel over to single shot, and very carefully put a toxin dart
        through the center of a heroin factory. The semiotics of the bright void
        beyond the chain link. The semiotics of the bright void beyond the chain
        link. They floated in the center of his closed left eyelid. Before they
        could stampede, take flight from the banks of every computer in the
        human system. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow
        foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the
        spherical chamber.
